# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	Version control tracks each and all of the changes to a code. This marks each step along the editing process, so if mistakes are made you can go back to an earlier version to see where things went wrong.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	A master branch is the "original" code. A or several feature branch(es) can then be added to edit the master branch. The feature branches can then be merged into the master branch at different times. This allows several people to edit a code which can then be merged back into the master.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	A commit is like a save or checkpoint. It marks the changes that have been made in a branch, so a good message would be something concise but descriptive. You want to make sure you can go back and know what was done in that commit, so that if there is a problem, you can see the exact changes in each commit.
* What is a merge conflict?
	A merge conflict is an error code when merging branches. The conflict occurs when the same areas of the code are edited in different branches.
